WolfCMS-Gallery
===============

Simple, easy to setup and use gallery plugin for WolfCMS. It was built for several clients and modified to be somewhat dynamic but is not quite complete yet.


Installation
-------------
Download or clone the repository into **/wolf/plugins/gallery**. When the plugin is enabled for the first time the database tables will be made for it. Under **/wolf/plugins/gallery/models** is the schema for the items and categories so you can choose what fields you want and use, just be sure to uninstall and re-enable the plugin if you do so (Note: This will delete all data, so choose the fields you will use before entering data).
